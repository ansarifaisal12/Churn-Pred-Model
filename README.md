# Churn-Pred-Model
Bank Customer Churn Prediction Model
This is a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer of a bank is likely to churn (i.e., close their account). It is based on a dataset that includes information about customers such as their credit score, age, gender, account balance, and more.

# Prerequisites
Before running this model, make sure you have the following:

Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
You can install these packages using pip or conda. For example, to install NumPy using pip, run the following command:

Copy code
pip install numpy
# Running the Model
To run the model, follow these steps:

 Download the dataset from here and save it in the same directory as the code.

 Open churn_prediction.py in your preferred Python IDE or text editor.

 Run the code. It will load the dataset, preprocess it, train a random forest classifier, and evaluate its performance on a test set.

The output will show the accuracy score and confusion matrix of the model. Additionally, three visualization examples will be shown: feature importance plot, age distribution plot, and correlation matrix plot.

You can modify the code to experiment with different preprocessing techniques, machine learning algorithms, or visualization methods.
